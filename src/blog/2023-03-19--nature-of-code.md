title: Nature of Code
---

I recently found **Nature of Code**[^1] through the library **Nannou**[^2]. The
library itself is a creative coding lib for rust. They themselves have a series
of examples that are taken from the excercises of Nature of Code. I am
interested in the library also. I've done some projects using Rust in the past
which I really enjoyed, and the library itself both provides processing like
graphics abilities, but also the ability to interface with physical electronics.
This is all very interesting to me, but I'm presently more interested in the
following along with the book.

I am fascinated by emergence. Creating systems that spontaniously create new
outcomes. This is something we are surrounded by in nature and something I want
to recreate in art. Art in programming specifically seems like an ideal tool to
pursue creating emergent systems. Nature of Code specifically seems like a good
starting point for this. Before all that though, I want a platform to share this
work. I want one because it feels more impactful to do the work, perhaps I'll
generate some extra motivation through it. Or just generally I won't quite feel
like I'm throwing things into a void.

No matter what reason, this is that, tjt.dev is a site I've been wanting to make
for awhile now. A place for me to muse and explore, starting with this Nature of
Code.
